# Thresholding function
# 'y' is an array of values
# 'lag' is the size of window to use to calculate a moving average (i.e. smoothed values)

# The threshold for 'events' is calculated from +/- abs('base' + 'multi' * current window std. dev.)  
# 'base' is the size of initial threshold between the current value and the smoothed value over which an 'event' may be considered to occur.
# 'multi' is the multiplier applied to the current standard deviation. 
# 'influence' is the relative importance of the new raw value to the last filtered value.
